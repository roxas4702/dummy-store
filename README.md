# Dummy Store

This is my final front-end project for [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it). <br/>
I made a simple fake e-commerce to train my web developing skills. The app uses Fake Store API to get the products and use-cart hook to manage shopping cart.

# Used technologies:

* HTML, Sass, JS
* Bootstrap (for dropdowns)
* React
* [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) (to get the products)
* [react-use-cart hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-use-cart) (to manage shopping cart)
* React Router (v5)
* Axios
* Node.js
